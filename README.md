Java Applet originally developed by Eisenblaetter, Neubert, Wahle 1997

I found this code at [http://duepublico.uni-duisburg-essen.de/servlets/DocumentServlet?id=160].  It didn't have a license when I found it.  Joachim Wahle granted permission to use the code in the present way by email on 27-jun-2017.  I am using it for teaching purposes, and for those purposes will make one or the other modification.
